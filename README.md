A high-end, 3D interactive tracking dashboard for cryptocurrency prices. This project uses **Three.js** to render a glowing orb that changes color based on real-time market trends (Green for UP, Red for DOWN).

## ✨ Features

- **3D Visualization**: A rotating Icosahedron geometry that reacts to data.
- **Live Crypto Data**: Fetches real-time prices for BTC, ETH, and SOL using the CoinGecko API.
- **Cyberpunk UI**: Glassmorphism cards, neon accents, and deep dark mode.
- **Fully Responsive**: The 3D camera adapts to mobile screens (`index.html`) and includes a dedicated Vision page (`future.html`).

## 📂 Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main dashboard with the 3D lamp and controls.
- `future.html`: A conceptual "Vision 2030" page linked from the main site.
- `README.md`: Documentation (You are here).
